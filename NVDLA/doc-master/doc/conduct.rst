Open NVDLA Code of Conduct
**************************

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project
and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level
of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

Our standards
=============

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:


* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention
  or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or
  electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

Our responsibilities
====================

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
=====

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a
project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Reporting violations
====================

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the NVDLA core maintainership team at
`nvdla@nvidia.com <mailto:nvdla@nvidia.com>`_.  The NVDLA core
maintainership team will determine whether the Code of Conduct was violated,
and will issue an appropriate sanction, possibly including a written warning
or expulsion from the project, project-affiliated spaces, or project
discussion environments.  We ask that you make a good-faith effort to
resolve your conflict before submitting a report.

Violations of the Code of Conduct can occur in any setting, even those
unrelated to the project. We will only consider complaints about conduct
that has occurred within one year of the report.

If the NVDLA core maintainership team receives a report alleging a violation
of the Code of Conduct, they will notify the accused of the report, and
provide them an opportunity to discuss the report before a sanction is
issued.  The NVDLA team will do their utmost to keep the reporter anonymous. 
If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment), or involves
a threat to anyone's safety (e.g.  threats of violence), the NVDLA team may
issue sanctions without notice.
