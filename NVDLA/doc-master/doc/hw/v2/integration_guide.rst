Introduction
============

This document introduces essential knowledge for how to integrate NVDLA into
an SoC.  It includes detail on bus interfaces, power on sequence, address
map, cell requirements, and synthesis.

The open source repository contains the NVDLA design RTL, a testbench, a
performance estimation spreadheet, and a set of synthesis scripts.  

Hardware System Interface
=========================

Overview
--------

NVDLA is a fixed function accelerator engine which is targeted towards deep
learning.  This section introduces the NVDLA external interface and
recommended connections.

System Diagram
--------------
The following diagram shows the NVDLA connections to an SoC.

NVDLA receives commands from the host processor via the CSB interface.  The two
independent memory interfaces provide access to storage for
data feeding NVDLA and output data from NVDLA.  The interrupt provides a notification
to a controlling CPU that NVDLA has completed a task.

Interfaces
----------
NVDLA's external pins are grouped into the following interfaces:

#. Clock and Reset interface
#. System Data interface
#. Configure interface
#. Interrupt interface
#. Power control
#. DFT interface

Clock and reset interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are two clock domains in NVDLA, dla_core_clk and dla_csb_clk. They are 
asynchronous with respect to each other, and have no required frequency relationship.
Most of the sub-units 
are in dla_core_clk domain. The Csb_master sub-unit which translates configuration 
commands from host clock domain to dla_core_clk domain. To reduce power consumptions, 
clock gating technology has been deployed in NVDLA. 

The main reset signal of NVDLA is dla_reset_rstn. Internal to NVDLA it's synchronized to 
one of the two clock domains before use.  The NVDLA design utilizaes asynchronous reset
flops, so only the deassertion edge of the dla_reset_rstn signal is synchronized.  The 
assertion edge is passed through.
The other reset signal, direct_reset\_, is 
useful for ATPG testing since it bypasses the internal synchronization.

     - System reset controller, can be hard-wired control logic or connect to register if SW reset is desired.

System Data Interfaces (DBBIF and SRAMIF)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NVDLA accesses external data through two data master interfaces: DBBIF and SRAMIF
In the RTL these are are sometimes referred to as dbb and cvsram.  Later version will 
likely all references to dbbif and sramif.
DBBIF typically is connected to off chip DRAM and provides high bandwidth with longer latency. SRAMIF 
is typically connected to an on-chip SRAM and provides high bandwidth with low.
In current release the bus interfaces are designed to run optimally with max latency on DBBIF of up to 
1440 cycles and an SRAMIF latency of up to 128 cycles. 
To support the two different memory subsystem characteristics there are some minor difference in 
implementation between the NVDLA's bus interface logic between DBBIF and SRAMIF. 

More information on the DBBIF and SRAMIF interfaces, including signal naming, can be found
in the NVDLA Hardware Architecture Guide.

Configuration Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The host uses the CSB (Config Space Bus) interface to access NVDLA registers. Each request to 
CSB has a fixed request size of 32 bits of data, and has a fixed 16-bit address size.  
CSB does not support any form of burst requests; each packet sent down the request channel 
is independent from any other packet.

A detailed interface description of the configuration interface can be found in NVDLA Architecture document.



Power control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the target library the RAM cells in NVDLA could be gated to reduce power 
consumption when NVDLA is inactive. Each layout partition has one ram power control bus, allowing
power to be ramped up/down one or more partitions at a time.  If a user is using RAM cells 
without power controls, those signals can be tied to 0.

Tree Build
==========

Please follow instructions in :doc:`environment_setup_guide`, section
*Tools and Dependency Libraries Setup* to setup environment and section
*Build test bench and run protect tests* to run a small set of tests to make
sure tree is in good health.

If CMOD is also be required to integrate to system level cmod environment.
Please follow :doc:`environment_setup_guide`, section *Build CMOD* to build
CMOD headers and dynamically linked shared object.

Performance Model
=================

Included in the repository is a spreadsheet based performance model.  This spreadsheet models the
performance for three popular convolutional networks: AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet50.  Additional
networks could be added by following the structure of the three provided.  Performance calculated
is ideal performance as it doesn't account for some software overhead.  The spreadsheet is located
in the repository at hw/perf/DLA_OpenSource_Performance.xlsx.  The first tab in the spreadsheet, named
"Readme", describes how the model works.  It calculates the following metrics.

* Average run time for a frame
* Frames per second
* Hardware MAC utilization
* Network MAC utilization

The tool can be used to look at the affect of different hardware configurations on network performance.


Library Cells
=============

There are a few library cells which the NVDLA design requires.  These cells are instantiated 
by the design, but only behavioral models are provided.  The integrator will need to provide 
a mapping to a technology library.  Typically, the effort would be to create a Verilog 
wrapper module which has the same ports as the RTL version provided in the release, and 
which instantiates a standard cell or memory from a local library.

Synchronizers
-------------

The NVDLA design instantes four types of clock domain crossing synchronizers.  These cells
are modelled with RTL Verilog so they are synthesizable.  However, like all synchronizers, 
they should be replaced with a standard cell designed to reduce MTBF.  To replace, the
RTL impelemtnation of the cells below can be removed (keeping the port list), and replaced
with an instantiation of a standard cell synchronizer as appropriate.

* p_SSYNC2DO_C_PP

  Two flop stage deep synchronizer with an active low asynchronous reset/clear pin.  

* p_SSYNC3DO

  Three flop stage deep synchronizer.

* p_SSYNC3DO_C_PPP

  Three flop stage deep synchronizer with an active low asynchronous reset/clear pin.

* p_SSYNC3DO_S_PPP

  Three flop stage deep synchronizer with an active low asynchronous set pin.


Memories (SRAM)
---------------

The memories instantiated in the NVDLA design have a logical interface which is fairly common 
across RAM compilers.  The release contains a behavioral model for these RAMS which can be 
used for simulation.  For synthesis, these behavioral models will need to be replaced with 
a Verilog wrapper which maps to RAM cells from a local library.

All functionality for a RAM can be inferred from the RAM name::

RAMDP is a true dual port high density SRAM, which allows read and write to operate at the same time.
 
All write operations are synchronized to the rising edge of write memory clock, CLK_W. The SRAM core is written when WE = ‘1’.  
 
Read operation is synchronized to the rising edge of the read memory clock, CLK_R.  The SRAM core is read when RE = ‘1’.  
A latch holds the read data whenever RE = ‘0’. There is no write through capability.  
If the read address matches the write address, read out data may be corrupted.

  Pseudo Dual Port RAM Timing

The RAMPDP behaves like a dual port RAM, but is created by double clocking a single port RAM. 
It can perform a ‘single read’ (1R), a ‘single write’ (1W) or a ‘read followed by write’ (1R+1W) 
operation in any given clock cycle.
A read operation is performed when the signal RE is active high (RE= ‘1’). The output data 
will be driven to the output port RD in the same cycle read commands are issued.
A latch holds the read data when ‘RE’=0. A write operation is performed when WE is high (WE= ‘1’). 
The input data must be put on the input data bus WD at the same time with the write command.  
Note that if the read and write address match during a (1R+1W) operation, i.e. RE=WE=’1’, the 
read data will contain the previous contents of the RAM (read occurs before write).


Synthesis
=========

Overview
--------
This release contains reference synthesis setup for the NVDLA design with Design Compiler (Wireload Model/Topographical).

-------------------

The release directory structure for synthesis is shown below::

 <NVDLA_RELEASE>
    |--- syn
    |--- scripts
    |       |--- syn_launch.sh
    |       |--- default_config.sh
    |       |--- dc_run.tcl
    |       |--- dc_interactive.tcl
    |       `--- dc_app_vars.tcl
    |--- templates
    |       |--- config.sh
    |       `--- cg_latency_lut.tcl

           |--- NV_NVDLA_partition_o.sdc
           `--- NV_NVDLA_partition_p.sdc          

``NV_NVDLA_partition_*`` are synthesis **“TOP_NAMES”** - The designs will be compiled at this 
hierarchy, and netlists will be generated for these designs. These are independent 
sub-designs for synthesis, which are instantiated in a top-level wrapper. 

Requirements
------------

You will need a \*NIX machine able to run Design Compiler. 
The scripts have been tested with Design Compiler version 2016.12 and newer. 
Memory and CPU requirements vary. 

Synthesis Configuration
-----------------------
To be able to run synthesis, you will need a config file - You can use 
the “<NVDLA_ROOT>/syn/dc/templates/config.sh” file  as reference. This file is in “bash” syntax. 

There are many required and optional variables. Table below lists the supported

.. warning::
  We do not supply timing models or synthesizable RTL for the RAMs in the design. 
  These need to be provided by the user for the process node/ memory compiler being used. 
  
  Please DO NOT include ``${NVDLA_ROOT}/vmod/rams/model`` in the RTL_SEARCH_PATH - They are simulation models, not synthesizable.

   * - Variable
     - Comments
   * - ``TIGHTEN_CGE``
     - Boolean, “1” to enable over constraining the CG-Enable paths. See section 5.5.2 below
       Default is set to “0”
   * - ``CGLUT_FILE``
     - File containing the fanout-based CG over constraint lookup table to pessimize the CG enable paths. See section 5.5.2 below.
       Please see “${NVDLA_ROOT}/syn/templates/cg_latency_lut.tcl” for an example.
       Defaults to an empty string. 
   * - ``DC_NUM_CORES``
     - The number of CPU cores available for Design Compiler.
       Defaults to ‘1’ 
       Note: Single CPU core synthesis may see a long overall runtime. 
   * - ``AREA_RECOVERY``
     - Boolean, “1” to Run quick area optimization by undoing some optimizations on paths with positive slack. 
       Defaults to “1”.
   * - ``INCREMENTAL_RECOMPILE_COUNT``
     - Number of rounds of incremental compiles  to run in Design Compiler. 
       Defaults to “1” - This amounts to 2 rounds of compile, one for mapping - the “main” compile 
       and one for incremental optimization - the “incremental” compile.
   * - ``COMMAND_PREFIX``
     - String. 
       Defaults to an empty string. 
       This will be pre-fixed to the dc_shell command . 
       Use this to manage job submission  on LSF farm or grid, as appropriate. 
       Use literal strings “<MODULE>” and “<LOG>” to substitute module name and log directory for each TOP_NAMES. 
       In the absence of a command prefix, the synthesis  jobs for each TOP_NAMES will run serially. 
       If you do provide a command prefix, make sure that it is non-blocking, so that all synthesis jobs 
       can be parallelized. Otherwise, the jobs are run serially. 
       Example::

         export COMMAND_PREFIX="bsub -q some_queue -o <LOG>/<MODULE>.lsf.log"


Synthesis constraints
---------------------

Clock Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The clock constraints are provided through an SDC file. 
You will find reference constraints in “${NVDLA_ROOT}/syn/cons/NV_NVDLA_partition*.sdc”. 
These contain clock targets for the 16nm process. You will need to scale the clock 
constraints to the target process/synthesis corner as appropriate. 
The SDC files also contain some timing exceptions (false paths) as well.
Please populate the SDC files for all TOP_NAMES in a single directory, and set the CONS variable 
in the configuration file described in the previous section.

You can also add additional non-SDC constraints, like, for example, specific clock gating styles, etc. in <CONS>/NV_NVDLA_partition*.tcl

Clock Gate Enable Path Over constraining
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The flow allows for over constraining the CG enable paths to pessimize synthesis to take into account post-CTS latencies. 
This is achieved through a fanout-based lookup table in TCL syntax. See “${NVDLA_ROOT}/syn/templates/cg_latency_lut.tcl” for an example. 
Provide the path to this file as the CGLUT_FILE variable in the configuration file.
To enable the over constraining, please set TIGHTEN_CGE variable to 1 in the configuration file.

Physical Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are running physical synthesis, you can provide floorplans in DEF syntax for 
RAM/IO placement as input, depending on your physical implementation. 
Populate the DEF files for all TOP_NAMES in a single directory, and provide the path 
to the directory as the DEF variable. 

You can also provide constraints in TCL syntax, through “<CONS>/NV_NVDLA_partition*.tcl” files. 

Running synthesis
-----------------

You can run synthesis using the “${NVDLA_ROOT}/syn/dc/scripts/syn_launch.sh” bash script. 
The supported arguments to the scripts are in table below.

.. list-table:: Miscellaneous Options
   :widths: 10 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Argument
     - Explanation
   * - ``-config``
     - Path to the synthesis configuration file (see section 5.4)
       If not provided, the flow will look for a file called “config.sh” in the current directory. 
   * - ``-mode``
     - Specifies which tool to use for synthesis. Use one of the following::

        “wlm” => Use Design Compiler (non-topographical) for wireload model based synthesis (non-physical)
        “dct” => Use DC-Topographical
        “dcg” => Use DC-Graphical along with “-spg” in the compile command. 
        “de”  => Use DC Explorer for synthesis.
   * - ``-build``
     - Sandbox of synthesis. Optional. 
       Defaults to “``nvdla_syn_<timestamp>``”
   * - ``-modules``
     - Space separated list of modules to run synthesis on / restore database for. 
       If not specified, the TOP_NAMES must be populated in the configuration file.
   * - ``-restore``
     - Path to design database (in DDC format) to restore.

Running Non-physical synthesis (Wireload Models)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run::

    ${NVDLA_ROOT}/syn/dc/scripts/syn_launch.sh -mode wlm -config /path/to/config.sh

You will need to have a wire load model defined in your standard cell library, or in a 
separate file (in liberty syntax, as described in the lcug16_Defining_Wire_Load_Groups.htm 
on Synopsys solvnet)

In the configuration file the following variables are required to be defined::

  WIRELOAD_MODEL_NAME 
  TARGET_LIB 
  LINK_LIB 
  DC_PATH 

The following variables are optional::

 WIRELOAD_MODEL_FILE
