Setup tree.make and Build tree
------------------------------

Please follow instructions in :doc:`environment_setup_guide`, section
*Tools and Dependency Libraries Setup* to setup environment and section
*Build Test Bench* to build test bench before advancing to next section.

Quick Start
===========

After tree was built, we can run a test and a regression to validate
NVDLA environment is in good health.

Let’s create a directory named health_exam.

``TOT> mkdir health_exam``

``TOT> cd health_exam``

Running single test
-------------------

Let run a convolution tests

``TOT/health_exam> TOT/verif/tools/run_test.py -P nv_small dc_24x33x55_5x5x55x25_int8_0 -outdir dc_24x33x55_5x5x55x25_int8_output -wave -v nvdla_utb``

There are several files were generated under

``TOT/health_exam/dc_24x33x55_5x5x55x25_int8_output``

1. run_verdi.sh: which is used to kick-off Verdi to view simulation
   waveform

2. testout: which contains output logs

Running a list of tests
-----------------------

We can run a list of tests for wider health status check

``TOT/health_examp>TOT/verif/tools/run_plan.py -P nv_small -tp nv_small -atag protection -no_lsf -run_dir protection_tests -monitor``

Verification Suite
==================

NVDLA verification suite contains test bench, test plan and test suites.

Verification related files could be found under ``TOT/verif``:

::

    verif
    |-- regression
    |   `-- testplans
    |-- testbench
    |   |-- trace_generator
    |   `-- trace_player
    |--<some other directories>
    `-- tests
        |-- trace_tests
        `-- uvm_tests

Test Bench Architecture
-----------------------

NVDLA verification adopts coverage driven methodology which relies on
constrained random stimulus.

Test bench also need to support direct tests for other considerations
which require fixed invariant stimulus:

1. Protection tests for code commit quality check.

2. Sanity tests for fast flushing plain and simple bugs.

3. Tests from real application (real network).

Simulation flow is divided into two phases: stimulus recording (trace
generation) and stimulus playing (trace playing). There are independent
executables for different phases.

1. Trace generation: a trace generator response for generating traces
   from constrained random tests. It contains with random constraints
   and random test suite.

2. Trace playing: a trace player response for driving trace to DUT,
   checking DUT correct behavior, and collecting coverages. It contains
   with agents for interacting with DUT, reference mode for correct
   behavior checking and coverage model for verification completeness
   measurement.

Test Plan
---------

Test plan record tests and corresponding configurations for regression.
There is one test plan for one configuration project. Test plan file
location is:
``TOT/verif/regression/testplans``.

Currently, this only one valid test plan: ``NV_SMALL``.

Test Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~

One test plan contains several test levels:

-  Level 0: Pass through cases which are based read data from memory and
   write to memory without function operation. Basic function tests.
   Most of protection tests will be select from this level.

-  Level 1: Common function case. Basic features such as major ASIC data
   path, special memory alignments, tests are single layer tests.

-  Level 2: Corner cases, for example, extreme small cube size (1x1x1 in
   width,height,channel), maximum width cube size (8192x1x1 in
   width,height,channel).

-  Level 3: reserved for multi-layer cases, run multiple layers on the
   same hardware pipelines.

-  Level 4: reserved for multi-scenario, running independent hardware
   pipelines (convolution, pdp, cdp) in the same time.

-  Level 5: reserved for perf tests

-  Level 6: reserved for power tests

-  Level 7: reserved for time-consumed tests

-  Level 8: reserved for real network cases

-  Level 9: reserved

-  Level 10: random tests for single scenario

-  Level 11: random tests for multi scenario

Level 0 to 8 are considered as direct tests, level 10 to 11 are
considered as random tests. There are dedicated test list files for each
test level.

Associating Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test plan provides a method named add_test to associate tests with test
plan, in each test, there are 5 fields:

-  Name: test source name

-  Tags: tags for test selection

-  Args: required arguments for test simulation, arguments will be
   documented in test bench and

-  Config: target test bench, currently, there is only one valid test
   bench setting: nvdla_utb which stands for NVDLA Unit Test bench.

-  Module: use to distinguish different types of tests

-  Desc: test description

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    add_test(name='dc_24x33x55_5x5x55x25_int8_0',
             tags=['L0','cc','protection'],
             args=[FIXED_SEED_ARG, DISABLE_COMPARE_ALL_UNITS_SB_ARG],
             config=['nvdla_utb'],
             desc='''copied from cc_small_full_feature_5, kernel stride 4x3, unpacked, pad L/R/T/B, clip truncate 4, full weight''')
    

Test Suite
----------

There are two kinds of tests:

1. Direct tests: direct tests are in trace format. Test source files are
   under TOT/verif/tests/trace. Trace tests are organized by
   configuration project. Trace tests for NV_SMALL configuration is
   under ``TOT/verif/tests/trace_tests/nv_small``.

2. Random tests: random tests are in UVM test format. Random tests are
   expected to be configuration independent. Random test directory is
   ``TOT/verif/tests/trace_tests/uvm_tests``.

*\*For now, only trace tests are ready.*

Test naming
~~~~~~~~~~~

Test naming is convenience for fast understanding test scenarios. There
are several portions in test name:

<MAJOR_FUNCTIONS>_<DIMEMSION_SETTINGS>_<SUPPLEMENTARY_INFO>_<MINOR_FUNCTIONS>_<PRECISION>_<INDEX>

Trace Test format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In unit test bench, trace player only receives tests in trace format.
Trace test is the source format of direct tests and the inter-media
outputs of random tests.

Trace test is not only used in unit RTL verification environment, but
also could be reused in other environments like system verification,
CMOD verification, FPGA validation, and silicon bringup.

Trace format supports following cases:

1. Single layer case: only one hardware pipeline and only one
   configuration group will be exercised during simulation.

2. Multi-layer case: configuration group will be alternative used during
   simulation within the same hardware pipeline.

3. Multi-resource cases: one hardware pipeline which consists of
   multiple hardware resource. For example, a fused
   convolution-batch_normlization-relu-pooling layer could be executed
   in single hardware layer, this hardware layer requires several
   computational resources convolution, SDP and PDP.

4. Multi-scenario case: multiple independent hardware layer
   configuration could be presented in the same test.

Trace stores the stimulus of simulation. There are two types of
stimulus, and there is dedicated format to support each type of
stimulus:

1. Register configuration, stored in config file (file name is \*.cfg).
   One test only has one configuration file.

2. Memory data, stored in data files (file name is \*.dat). One test has
   at least one memory data file for input data. One test could have
   more than one data file, for example, in convolution tests, there is
   one file for input image/feature cube and one file for weight.

Trace file also provide result checking methods:

1. Golden CRC, which is represented in one configuration command.

2. Golden output memory surface, which is represented in one
   configuration command and an associated data file.

Memory Surface File Format
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When mem_load command is shown in configuration file, test bench will
load corresponding file into memory model.

Memory surface format is in memory mapped form. The basic data group is
call packet, each packet item contains one address offset field, one
size field and one payload field. It's used to store data in payload
field to memory space starting from address (base + offset).

The string describing one packet item must be kept in one single line.

Payload byte must be separated by space, and payload size shall not be
no larger than 32 for readability consideration.

Different packets shall be joined by comma ",".

Example:

::

    {

    {offset:0x20, size:4, payload:0x00 0x10 0x20 0x30} ,

    {offset:0x60, size:4, payload:0x00 0x10 0x20 0x30}

    }

For packet ``{offset:0x20, size:4, payload:0x00 0x10 0x20 0x30}``, data
in memory layout is

+---------+------+------+------+------+
| Address | 0x20 | 0x21 | 0x22 | 0x23 |
+---------+------+------+------+------+
| Value   | 0x00 | 0x10 | 0x20 | 0x30 |
+---------+------+------+------+------+

Regression Tool Set
===================

There is a tool set for:

1. Running single test simulation.

2. Running a test plan, tests associated with specific test plan will be
   running. It could be considered as one round of regression.

3. Examining single round regression result and generate metrics for
   whole project lasting time.

Running a Single Test
---------------------

There is a script TOT/verif/tools/run_test.py for running single test,
the most common usages are:

``>TOT/verif/tools/run_test.py -P <project_name> -mod <test_module>
<trace_test_name> -outdir <output_directory> -v nvdla_utb``

Examining Result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several files were generated during simulation, three files
need to be paid more attention:

1. run_trace_player.sh: a script for rerunning test

2. run_verdi.sh: a script for kicking off Verdi to view waveforms

3. testout, log file

4. STATUS, file records test running status, there are several status:

   1. RUNNING, test is still in running.

   2. FAIL, test result is failure.

   3. PASS, test result is pass.

Running a Test Plan
-------------------

There is a script TOT/verif/tools/run_plan.py for running tests within a
test plan.

``>TOT/verif/tools/run_plan.py --test_plan <TEST_PLAN_NAME> -P <PROJECT>
-atag <and_tags> -otag <or_tags> -run_dir <RUN_DIR> -no_lsf -monitor``

Simulation results could be found under **run_dir**. There are 2
hierarchy levels under ``run_dir``

::

    RUN_DIR
    |-- <TEST_BENCH_0>
    |   |-- TEST_A
    |   |-- TEST_B
    |   |-- …
    |   `-- TEST_G
    `-- <TEST_BENCH_1>
        |-- TEST_H
        |-- …
        `-- TEST_N

1. The first level is test bench level. If a plan contains multiple test
   benches, there will be dedicated directory for each test bench

2. The second level is test level. Under test bench level, there are
   several test directories. Each directory contains temporal and result
   files for one test simulation.
